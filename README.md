# Brief Description

For our project we want to analyze how fashion/ clothing reviews have different keywords when used by males vs females. We will use the data to predict if reviews will be positive or negative based on the keywords.

# Stages
Stage 1: Collect clothing reviews from an online fashion retailer 
Stage 2: Sort data into male and female groups
Stage 3: Idetify frequently used words in each sub group
Stage 4: Study/ predict whether the keywords indicate/ suggest a negative or postive review and how the words reflect in different     genders.
